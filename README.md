**Resources for self-taught Software Engineer**

Hi there üëãüèΩ
Here is a summary of resources which you guys can use to become a software engineer or freshen up your knowledge.<br />
Let me know if you have other resources in mind that I did not consider. <br />
<br />
Even though there are a lot of resources out there which you can use to teach yourself on how to become a software engineer, here are the ones that I recommend because they seem legit to me. <br />

- **Open Source Society University** <br />
  They did an amazing job at gathering resources for each subject you actually learn in university. So check it out here https://github.com/ossu/computer-science
 
- **Google Certified Course in Coursera:** Google recently came out with a bunch of courses which you can take for free on coursera (you have to pay for membership). You will get a certification for each course you take which you can then use in your CV. I personbally did the Project Managment course and I must say it was done amazingly. Check them out here:  https://de.coursera.org/search?query=google& 

- **Books & Courses:** This one is not secret. There are so many good books and courses online on different plattforms (Udemy, Coursera, Khan academy,...) , which you can use. But before you start a course please take the time and research if it is what you want or not. I've heard from a ton of developers that the courses weren't as they expected them be, just because they did not read the description and were too lazy to do the research. 

- **Take advantage of YouTube:** Many developers and engineers upload their knowledge to youtube for free. So before you pay for anything you should always check out, what's on youtube and when you cannot find the information and satisfaction you are looking for, move on to another resource.
